###### Hi there <i class="far fa-smile-beam"></i> 
<small>I am a Ph.D. applicant for admission in Fall 2025. I am interested in using computational modeling and a multi-method approach (neurocognitive tasks, neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments) to identify transdiagnostic mechanisms of psychopathology, including but not limited to anxiety, mood, eating and related disorders.
</small>

<small>
I am currently a clinical research coordinator at Translational Research on Eating and Affect (TREAT) Lab under the mentorship of Dr. Kelsey Hagan, coordinating neuroimaging and neurocognitive studies investigating mechanisms of eating disorders. I completed my master's thesis examining self-referential processing bias in anorexia nervosa with drift-diffusion model under the mentorship of Dr. Lisa Ranzenhofer at Columbia Center for Eating Disorders.

 <!-- I am committed to developing novel evidence-based interventions for these disorders using an idiographic approach that targets person-specific maintenance and cultural factors. -->

<!-- ## Coding and Task Development <i class="fas fa-code"></i>
<p class="smallfont">Here are the list of computer tasks that I coded in Python/Javascript. See more on GitHub page.

<b>5. <i>Web Surf Task.py, ~.js, ~.psychojs</i></b>
This task, originally developed by <i>Abram et al. (2019)</i>, presents different amounts of time to forage for videos across four types and asks participants to choose whether to stay and wait or skip the video to assess their visual and decision-makingprocessing.

<b>4. <i>Incentive Flanker Task.py</i></b>
This task, originally developed by <i>Norman et al. (2021)</i>, presents five letters, one of which is the target letter, in high/low interference conditions with high/low rewards and asks people to identify the target letter to earn rewards in order to assess their cognitive control and reward processing.

<b>3. <i>Two Step Decision Task.py</i></b>
This task, originally developed by <i>Foerde et al. (2021)</i>, presents a set of two choices (first two spaceships, then two aliens) at both model-based and model-free learning phases and asks people to learn the probability pattern to earn the reward associated with the choices to assess their goal-directed learning abilities.

<b>2. <i>Food Choice Task.py, ~.psyexp</i></b>
This task, originally developed by <i>Steinglass et al. (2014) and Foerde et al. (2015)</i>, presents 76 food images three times in three blocks: healthiness, tastiness, and preferences of the food items and asks participants to rate the items respectively on a Likert scale of 1 to 5 to assess their evaluations and preferences on high fat or low-fat food.

<b>1. <i>Visual Perceptual Organization Task.psyexp</i></b>
This task, <i>originally developed by Kurylo et al. (2018)</i>, presents 20 x 20 dot arrays of elements that indicate general organization (Horizontal or Vertical orientation) with motion/color differences at four difficulty levels, and asks participants to detect the stimuli orientations to assess their visual processing system. </p> -->
